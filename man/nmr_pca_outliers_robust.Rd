\usage{
nmr_pca_outliers_robust(nmr_dataset, ncomp = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{nmr_dataset}{An nmr_dataset_1D object}

\item{ncomp}{Number of rPCA components to use

We have observed that the statistical test used as a threshold for
outlier detection usually flags as outliers too many samples, due possibly
to a lack of gaussianity

As a workaround, a heuristic method has been implemented: We know that in the
Q residuals vs T scores plot from \code{\link[=nmr_pca_outliers_plot]{nmr_pca_outliers_plot()}} outliers are
on the right or on the top of the plot, and quite separated from non-outlier
samples.

To determine the critical value, both for Q and T, we find the biggest gap
between samples in the plot and use as critical value the center of the gap.

This approach seems to work well when there are outliers, but it fails when there
isn't any outlier. For that case, the gap would be placed anywhere and that is
not desirable as many samples would be incorrectly flagged. The
second assumption that we use is that no more than 10\% of
the samples may pass our critical value. If more than 10\% of the samples
pass the critical value, then we assume that our heuristics are not reasonable
and we don't set any critical limit.}
