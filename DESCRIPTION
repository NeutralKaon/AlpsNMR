Description: Reads Bruker NMR data directories.
 It allows to interpolate, exclude regions and normalize the samples,
 being tested in 1-D, with some support for 2-D and extendable for higher
 dimensionallity data.
 The package also provides NIHS irods integration, by extracting sample metadata,
 compressing sample directories in zip files and pushing them to iRods.
 Efficient plotting with 1-D data is also available and a shiny Graphical
 User Interface is also provided for an easy visualization.
 Basic reading of 1D  ACD/Labs exported JDX samples is also available.
