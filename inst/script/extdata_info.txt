To explore the basics of the AlpsNMR package, we have included three NMR
samples acquired in a 600 MHz Bruker instrument bundled with the package.
The samples are pooled quality control plasma samples, that were extracted
with methanol, and therefore only contain small molecules.

If you have installed this package, you can obtain the directory where the four
samples are with the command:

MeOH_plasma_extraction_dir <- system.file("dataset-demo", package = "AlpsNMR")
MeOH_plasma_extraction_dir

The demo directory includes three samples (zipped) and a dummy Excel metadata file.

list.files(MeOH_plasma_extraction_dir)

This is just some quality control dataset, the metadata is just a simple dummy table:

MeOH_plasma_extraction_xlsx <- file.path(MeOH_plasma_extraction_dir, "dummy_metadata.xlsx")
annotations <- readxl::read_excel(MeOH_plasma_extraction_xlsx)
annotations
